  abstract  = {Communication from a low- to a high-level system without acknowledgements will be unreliable; with acknowledgements, it can be insecure. We propose to provide quantifiable security, acceptable reliability, and minimal performance penalties by interposing a device (called the Pump) to push messages to the high system and provide a controlled stream of acknowledgements to the low system.This paper describes how the Pump supports the transmission of messages upward and limits the capacity of the covert timing channel in the acknowledgement stream without affecting the average acknowledgement delay seen by the low system or the message delivery delay seen by the high system in the absence of actual Trojan horses. By adding random delays to the acknowledgment stream, we show how to further reduce the covert channel capacity even in the presence of cooperating Trojan horses in both the high and low systems. We also discuss engineering trade-offs relevant to practical use of the Pump.},

However, usage of encryption finds its limitations in case of an unauthorized information flow via covert channels. Some covert storage and timing channels inherent in a LAN's architecture are already described in the literature. This paper takes a more general approach. It shows, that there is a potential of unused bandwidth in commonly used LAN protocols (IEEE 802.2, 802.3, 802.4, 802.5), which might be exploitable as covert channel. The key point is, that exploitation of this potential of unused bandwidth is not a question of a LAN's architecture, but is strongly dependent on the design of its internal interfaces and on its implementations.},

Because individual connections commonly exceed this speed, it is clear that existing systems violate the current specification. This document updates the specification of the IPv4 ID field in RFCs 791, 1122, and 2003 to more closely reflect current practice and to more closely match IPv6 so that the field's value is defined only when a datagram is actually fragmented. It also discusses the impact of these changes on how datagrams are used. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}}

  abstract  = {Two accomplices in a crime have been arrested and are about to be locked in widely separated cells. Their only means of communication after they are locked up will he by way of messages conveyed for them by trustees -- who are known to be agents of the warden. The warden is willing to allow the prisoners to exchange messages in the hope that he can deceive at least one of them into accepting as a genuine communication from the other either a fraudulent message created by the warden himself or else a modification by him of a genuine message. However, since he has every reason to suspect that the prisoners want to coordinate an escape plan, the warden will only permit the exchanges to occur if the information contained in the messages is completely open to him -- and presumably innocuous. The prisoners, on the other hand, are willing to accept these conditions, i.e., to accept some risk of deception in order to be able to communicate at all, since they need to coordinate their plans. To do this they will have to deceive the warden by finding a way of communicating secretly in the exchanges, i.e., of establishing a ``subliminal channel'' between them in full view of the warden, even though the messages themselves contain no secret (to the warden) information{\textdaggerdbl}. Since they anticipate that the warden will try to deceive them by introducing fraudulent messages, they will only exchange messages if they are permitted to authenticate them.},
