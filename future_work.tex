\chapter{Future work}

The framework proposed has many issues that prevent its effective use in a real-world scenario:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No attempt at having a valid cover text:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The scope of this paper was the protocols involved in communication, however, the payload data is incredibly important to the application of the framework in the real world. The covertness of the communication is only as strong as the weakest link, in this case, it is the overt traffic.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The current channel algorithm is na\"ive:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The algorithm only observes the number of possible cover texts, however, the nature of that traffic is equally important, If the majority of traffic is HTTPS but it all goes to a local proxy then HTTPS traffic to a different destination is suspicious.
        \item This is not to say that the proposed algorithm is bad, it still evaluates the protocol to use very well.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
